This guide outlines the simple steps required to migrate any application from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to APIpie, leveraging our compatible API structure.

## Introduction

If your application currently uses OpenAI, transitioning to APIpie is straightforward. Our API accepts the same structured requests, meaning you only need to update the base URL to migrate seamlessly. For more information on OpenAI's API structure, you might refer to [OpenAI API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference).

## Migration Steps

### 1. Create an Account

- **Link**: [Register here](https://apipie.ai/dashboard/auth/register)* Follow the link and fill out the form to create your account.

### 2. Add Credit

- **Link**: [Add Credit](https://apipie.ai/dashboard/profile/subscribe)* Access the subscription section after logging in to add credits to your account.

### 3. Generate an API Key

- **Link**: [Generate API Key](https://apipie.ai/dashboard/profile/api-keys)* Navigate to the API keys section and create a new key. This key is necessary for API requests.

### 4. Update Your API Configuration

- Locate where your application is configured to communicate with OpenAI, typically where the base URL for OpenAI is set.
- Change the base URL from OpenAI’s URL (e.g., `https://api.openai.com/v1`) to APIpie’s URL `https://apipie.ai/v1`.
- Update your configured API key to match the new APIpie API key

### 5. Test Your Application

After updating your configuration, perform thorough testing to ensure all functionalities are operating as expected with APIpie.

### Why Migrate to APIpie?

Migrating to APIpie provides several benefits:

- **Compatibility**: Seamless transition with minimal code changes required.
- **Enhanced Features**: Access to a broader range of features and improvements over existing services.
- **Redundancy and advanced routing**: Never lose connectivity with redundant providers for all major models and advanced price or speed based routing.
